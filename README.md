# Social-links-profile-challenge
This project consists of developing a profile component for social media links, based on the challenge provided by Frontend Mentor.

> [!TIP]
> Taking into account the feedback from the previous challenge, I set out to learn how to use the BEM methodology for css [BEM](https://getbem.com/).<br>
> Use as main measure rem or em. <br>
> Optimize the graphics that matter with font-display: swap. <br>
